This is a refactoring "kata" or exersise.  So far I have worked only on the C++ version
in [expensereport-cxx/](expensereport-cxx/).  The goal is to refactor while adding a new expense report type
for Lunch.  See [expensereport-cxx/README-reedhedges.md](expensereport-cxx/README-reedhedges.md) for more info
